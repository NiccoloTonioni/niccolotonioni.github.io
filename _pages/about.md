Hello!
My research focuses on fluid dynamical system prediction 🌪️ using deep-learning methods as autoencoders 🤖

I'm a proud alumni of the Von Karman Institute 🎓, where I was student representative. The year at the Von Karman heightened my passion for research by allowing me to engage with researchers from all around the world through their compelling lectures.

My Master's degrees are the results of an European partnership 🇪🇺 among aerospace universities known as Pegasus. My master's thesis project garnered recognition for special achievement 🏆 from Politecnico of Milan due to my involvement in academic research aboard.

I lived more than 3 years in Belgium 🇧🇪 and I'm still very attached to its culture 🍟🍫

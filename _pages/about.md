Hello!
My research focuses on fluid dynamical system prediction 🌪️,leveraging deep-learning methods as autoencoders 🤖

I'm a proud alumni of the Von Karman Institute 🎓, where I was student representative. My time there deepened my passion for research, allowing me to engage with researchers from all around the world.

My Master's degrees are the results of an European partnership 🇪🇺 among aerospace universities known as Pegasus. My master's thesis project garnered recognition for special achievement 🏆 from Politecnico of Milan due to my involvement in academic research aboard.

Having lived in Belgium 🇧🇪 for over three years, I remain deeply connected to its rich culture 🍟🍫. However, as a true Italian at heart 🇮🇹 , pizza reigns supreme, and on special Sundays, I honor family tradition by making my own pasta, just like my grandmother did.

excerpt: 'This work studies the accuracy of Linear Eddie Viscosity models on the prediction of wingtip vortex flow. The geometry selected for the study is a NACA-0012 half wing mounted at the wall, with a rounded end cap and trailing edge, inclined by 10° at its quarter chord. Computations of the flow were conducted using the open source software SU2. Two turbulence closures were investigated: the Negative Spalart-Allmaras and the Menter’s Shear Stress Transport models. The flow was considered at two Reynolds and Mach numbers : Re = 4.3 x 10e6 , M = 0.14 and Re = 1.2 x 10e6 , M = 0.1. '
